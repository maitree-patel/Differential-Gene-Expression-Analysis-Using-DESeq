# Gene-Expression-Analysis-Using-DESeq
Analysing gene expression data, count matrix normalization, manipulation and visualization in R using DESeq2 package.

Count matrix was obtained online from refine.bio website (GSE36687 accession number from Gene Expression Omnibus source repository) on the RNA expression from fetal liver of RNaseh2b KOF mice and from wild type exmbryos. Data gene expression count matrix for contains 6 samples across genes.
