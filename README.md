# Gene-Expression-Analysis-Using-DESeq
An exploratory practice of manipulation, analysis of gene expression data and visualization in R using DESeq2 package.

Count matrix was obtained online from refine.bio website (GSE36687 accession number from Gene Expression Omnibus source repository) on the RNA expression from fetal liver of RNaseh2b KOF mice and from wild type exmbryos. Gene expression count matrix contains 6 samples across all the genes.
